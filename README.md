## This is a OOPS assignment I got for the end semester.

**Problem Statement** : `Develop a plugin system using interfaces and dynamic class loading.`

# My Approach

> I created a database system (kinda of with single table and only string datatype).

> I have provided two formatters as core features : Default Formatter and CSV Formatter and Users can add other formatters through plugins in the runtime.

> I also provided plugins for JSONFormatters and XMLFormatter.

> **Added** : Now Data can be exported to all available formats.
